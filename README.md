# MirrorFigure
Structured Nested Loops Mirror Figure

This is a mirror figure created using for loops in Java. The code consists of a Figure class that defines three methods TBrow(), TopHalf(), and BottomHalf(), and a main method that calls these methods to generate the figure.

How to run the code
Copy the code into a file named Figure.java.
Compile the code using the javac command: javac Figure.java.
Run the code using the java command: java Figure.
What the figure looks like
The mirror figure generated by this code consists of a series of rows and columns of characters. The figure has a mirror symmetry, meaning that if you drew a line down the middle of the figure, the left and right sides would be reflections of each other.


How the code works
The Figure class defines three methods:

TBrow(): Prints the very top and bottom rows of the figure.
TopHalf(): Prints the top half of the figure.
BottomHalf(): Prints the bottom half of the figure.
These methods use for loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the figure and print out the appropriate characters. The main method calls these methods in the appropriate order to generate the complete figure.

The MirrorSize constant controls the size of the figure, and can be adjusted to make the figure larger or smaller.
